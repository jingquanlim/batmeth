=Installation=


To install the package, do the following.
  # untar the package:
{{{
tar -zxvf batmethxxxx
}}}
  # change to installation directory batmetxxxx
{{{
cd batmethxxxx
}}}
  # Configure and Install
{{{
./configure
make
make copy
}}}

=Building Indexes.=

All executables of this package can be found in batmethxxxx/bin folder after {{{make copy}}}.

Two sets of indexes needs to be built. They are built by calling build_index as follows.
  # build_index GENOME GTOA
  # build_index GENOME CTOT

1) will turn all G's to A's and build an index with the base name GENOME-GtoA

2) will turn all C's to T's and build an index with the base name GENOME-CtoT

*# To build the required indexes and delete unwanted files run the script `build_all GENOME`*

=Mapping=


To map the data set METH to the genome with base name GENOME do,
{{{
./batmeth -g GENOME -i INPUT_METH -n <number of mismatches> -o <Output_Prefix>
./split <FINAL_RESULT> GENOME <number of mismatches> y <all...output...files...from...batmeth...>
}}}

=Output=

{{{<Final_result>}}} will contain all uniquely mapped hits (after PCR duplicated removal) in the following format:
  Line 1: `Header`

  Line 2: `<read_ID> <Original Read>`

  Line 3: `<read-orientation> <chrNum> <strand> <chrPos_0> <mismatch> <read_length>`

`<read-orientation>` is an integer: [1-4]. 1 & 3 has the read and reverse-complement of the read mapped to a C->T converted reference respectively. 2 & 4 will have its read and reverse-complement of the read mapped to a G->A converted reference respectively.

Please ignore the other fields which are appended to the end of the lines.

=Sample Run=
{{{[linux]$ .batmeth -g genome.fa -i query.fa -n 2 -p 4 -O 1}}}<br>{{{[linux]$ .split output.out genome.fa 2 y query.fa.0 query.fa.1 query.fa.2 query.fa.3}}}
