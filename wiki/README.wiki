=Installation=


To install the package, do the following.
  # untar the package:
{{{
tar -zxvf batmethxxxx
}}}
  # change to installation directory batmetxxxx
{{{
cd batmethxxxx
}}}
  # Configure and Install
{{{
./configure
make
make copy
}}}

=Building Indexes.=

All executables of this package can be found in batmethxxxx/bin folder after {{{make copy}}}.

Two sets of indexes needs to be built. They are built by calling build_index as follows.
  # build_index GENOME GTOA
  # build_index GENOME CTOT

1) will turn all G's to A's and build an index with the base name GENOME-GtoA

2) will turn all C's to T's and build an index with the base name GENOME-CtoT

# To build the required indexes and delete unwanted files run the script `build_all`

=Mapping=


To map the data set METH to the genome with base name GENOME do,
{{{
batmeth -g GENOME -i METH -n <number of mismatches> -o <Output_File>
split <Output_File> GENOME <number of mismatches> y <Final_result>
}}}

=Output=

{{{<Final_result>}}} will contain all uniquely mapped hits (after PCR duplicated removal) in the following format:
  Line 1: `Header`

  Line 2: `<read_ID> <Original Read>`

  Line 3: `<read-orientation> <chrNum> <strand> <chrPos_0> <mismatch> <read_length>`
