#Release_Notes

===Note===
BatMeth scans up to 5 mismatches per read. If the rate of mismatch in the read is high, we recommend you to try the -F option which trims a read from the 3' end prior to mapping.

===Next Version===
Fixed Total Read count output to display.

===Version 1.04b===
Added a per-base methylation information string to each hit (BatMeth-Illumina version). Please read wiki page for BatMeth-Illumina for more details. [http://code.google.com/p/batmeth/wiki/README_ILLUMINA]

Fixed some issues that prevent smooth compiling in various Linux platforms. (Maths functions: pow, sqrt, etc were causing some problems under some versions of GCC)

Fixed index-loading glitch.

Fixed index-building glitch.

Added the ability to handle genomes with an arbitrary number of chromosomes.

Reduced the size of index for BatMeth_SOLiD (temporary files are removed)

Changed BatMeth_SOLiD default mapping read-length to 36bp. Can be changed by {{{-F <integer>}}} option.
